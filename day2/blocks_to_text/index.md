# From Blocks to Text

## About 

In this session, you will learn about:

- The differences between *Blocks*, *Hybrid* and *Text* Languages
- Why you might chose a particular type of Language to teach *Coding* to your students
- Examples of different *Blocks*, *Hybrid* and *Text* Languages

After a presentation about moving students from *Blocks languages* to *Text languages*, there will be an activity focused on [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/){:target="_blank"}.
*Sonic Pi* is a program that allows you to write music with code. 
Like *Scratch*, it's easy to get started *Coding* this tool, but you can also write quite complex programs (compositions) using it.

Sonic Pi was created by a Computer Science researcher, [Dr Sam Aaron](http://sam.aaron.name/){:target="_blank"}.
Dr Aaron also worked with educators to develop lesson plans for *Sonic Pi* (see the *Links* section below) that map to the UK's *Computing curriculum* (the equivalent of Australia's *Digital Technologies curriculum*).

The *Sonic Pi* activity will show how some of the fundamental *Coding* concepts can be used to create a song. 
The main *Coding* concepts in this activity, which you may remember from the *Coding in Scratch Activity* yesterday, are:

- *Sequencing*
- *Repetition*
- *Branching*

You will also learn about *Threads* and *Randomisation*, which are other concepts that are often used in creating *programs*.

If you complete the *Sonic Pi* activity before the end of the session or have already started to begin using Text languages with your students, you may be interested in the [Reddit learnprogramming communityâ€™s FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq){:target="_blank"}, which offers some very helpful advice for beginning coders.

In this section, we have included links to websites for examples of the different types of *Coding* languages that are commonly used in K-12 education, as well as links to resources for learning and teaching *Sonic Pi*.
