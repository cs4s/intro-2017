# Bebras

- Challenge with *Computational Thinking* questions
- Run twice annually in Australia
- For Year 3 to Year 12
- [Bebras 365](https://www.bebras.edu.au/bebras365/)
- Solution Guides

---

# Project Quantum

- A large question bank
	- Not just *Coding* and *Computational Thinking*
	- general *Digital Literacy* as well
- Involves registering a [Diagnostics Questions](https://diagnosticquestions.com/Quantum) account
- [Computing at School](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/) is one of the main contributors

---

# Dr Scratch

- [Online tool](http://www.drscratch.org/) for automatic assessment of *Scratch* programs
- Analyses a *Scratch* program and gives mark out of *21*
- Not ideal for measuring students' understanding
- Tool to support reflection and self-evaluation

---

# Debug Its

- Created for the *Creative Computing Curriculum Guide*
- *Scratch programs* which have some problem
- Students try and find the cause of the problem and fix it (*debugging*)
- There are Studios of *Debug It* problems from CC:
	- [Unit 2 (Animations)](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475539/)
	- [Unit 3 (Stories)](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475554/)

# Parsons' Problems

- [Mixed up](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/sigcse2017/Directives/mixedUp.html) snippets of *Code*
- Low cognitive load - don't have to recall syntax
- Students can focus on *Computational Thinking*
- Mostly used for *Text languages*
- Could be used for *Blocks languages* as well
	- [Example in Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/181770284/)
