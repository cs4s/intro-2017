# Assessing Coding / Computational Thinking

## About

In this session, we will give examples of some different approaches for assessing *Coding* and *Computational Thinking*.
Many of these examples are discussed in more detail in two different sources that we have drawn on for this presentation.
The first source is [Issue 3](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/issues/3){:target="_blank"} of the [Hello World](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/){:target="_blank"} magazine, which is a free online magazine for educators about computing and digital making.
The second source is the [Supporting teachers to assess Fâ€“10 Digital Technologies report](https://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/resourcedetail?id=24154798-09f9-6792-a599-ff0000f327dd#/){:target="_blank"} created by researchers from the [Computer Science Education Research (CSER) Group at the University of Adelaide](https://blogs.adelaide.edu.au/cser/){:target="_blank"} and [Education Services Australia](https://www.esa.edu.au/){:target="_blank"}.

## Bebras

[Bebras](https://www.bebras.edu.au/){:target="_blank"} is a challenge that is run bi-annually in Australia in which students answer problems that test their *Computational Thinking* ability.
The challenges are open to students from Year 3 to Year 12 and they contain questions that vary in difficulty (*Easy*, *Medium* and *Hard*).

You can also access and work through previous years' challenges' questions by following the *Challenge Questions* links on the [Bebras 365](https://www.bebras.edu.au/bebras365/){:target="_blank"} page of the *Bebras* website.
When you work through these questions, you will receive instant feedback on whether you answered them correctly or incorrectly.
There are also *Solution Guides* available for download from this page, which explain the answers to each of the questions and also describes how each of questions relates to different *Coding* and *Computational Thinking* concepts.

## Project Quantum

[Project Quantum](http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/resources/4382){:target="_blank"} is a project that involves developing a large bank of questions for assessing *Coding*, *Computational Thinking* and general *Digital Literacy*. 
To access and use questions from the *Project Quantum* question bank, you will have to register an account on the [Diagnostic Questions website](https://diagnosticquestions.com/Quantum){:target="_blank"}. 
Using this website, you can view the questions that have been created for *Project Quantum* and you you can also create your own questions. 
Then, you could use the *Diagnostic Questions* website to create quizzes for formative assessment of your students' *Coding* and *Computational Thinking* abilities.

One of the main organisations that has been involved in the development of *Project Quantum* is [Computing At School](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}. [Computing At School](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} is an organisation that provides support and guidance to many UK primary and high school teachers implementing the *Computing curriculum* (the UK's equivalent of the Australian *Digital Technologies* curriculum).

## Dr Scratch

[Dr Scratch](http://www.drscratch.org/){:target="_blank"} is an online tool for performing automatic assessment of *Scratch* programs. 
*Dr Scratch* analyses a *Scratch* project and gives a mark out of 3 for each of the following *Coding* concepts: *Flow control*, *Data representation*, *Abstraction*, *User interactivity*, *Synchronization*, *Parallelism* 	and *Logic*. 

You could try *Dr Scratch* on the *Dancing Cat* program that we created in *Scratch* yesterday. 
To do this, copy and paste this url: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173543499/ into the textbox above the *Analyze By URL* button and then click the button.
You will be able to see how the program scored for each concept and you can also click on each of the different concepts to be taken to a webpage that will explain why you received the number of points.
You may notice that the *Dancing Cat* program that we made does not score very well in *Dr Scratch* - it only scores 8 out of 21 possible points.
The score given by *Dr Scratch* is not necessarily a reflection of a students' understanding of *Coding* and *Computational Thinking*, the score is really a measure of how complex a *Scratch* program is.

The developers of *Dr Scratch* do note that the tool is in beta and is not intended to be used for diagnostic assessment without other assessment approaches.
They recommend that students use *Dr Scratch* as a tool to self-evaluate and reflect on the Scratch programs they create and that teachers use it as a tool to support formative assessment.
There are also some suggestions for using *Dr Scratch* for supporting students learning *Coding* and *Computational Thinking* on the [Digital Technologies Hub website](http://www.digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au/teachers/assessment/dr-scratch){:target="_blank"}

## Debug Its

*Debug Its* are *Scratch* programs that were created as part of the *Creative Computing Curriculum Guide* that we looked at [in an earlier workshop session]({{ site.baseurl | append: site.creative_computing_path }}){:target="_blank"}.

*Debug Its* are *Scratch* programs that have some problem that is preventing them from working as expected. 
For example, in [this Debug It](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10437040/){:target="_blank"} one of the sprites dance but the other does not.
To complete a *Debug It* activity, students need to figure out what is causing the problem and how to fix it.
This process of finding the problem and fixing it is called *Debugging*, which is often a large part of professional Software Engineers' and Computer Scientists' work. 

There are *Studios* of *Debug It* projects for most of the Units in the *Creative Computing Curriculum Guide* (except for Unit 0).
For example, there is a *Studio* of *Debug Its* for [Unit 2 (Animations)](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475539/){:target="_blank"} and [Unit 3 (Stories)](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/475554/){:target="_blank"}.
You may want to use these *Debug It* programs (or programs with problems that you create yourself) to help your students learn how to *debug* and check their understanding of certain *Coding* concepts.

## Parsons' Problems

[Parsons' Problems](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/sigcse2017/Directives/mixedUp.html){:target="_blank"} are small *Coding* problems where snippets of *Code* are given in random order and must be arranged in the right order to create a working program.
Sometimes students may get caught up in syntax errors in their code written in a *Text language* and lose focus on the *Computational Thinking* aspects of *Coding*.
Parsons' problems are intended to lower the cognitve load of *Coding* puzzles so that students can focus on the *Computational Thinking*.
*Parsons' problems* are used in the *CSLearning4U* eBooks that have been designed for teaching Computer Science to High School students and teachers in the US.
For example, on this page of the Students' Comptuer Science Principles eBook there is [a Parsons' Problem where students arrange *Code* to create a MadLib program](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/StudentCSP/CSPNameStrings/madlib.html){:target="_blank"}.

Most examples of *Parsons' Problems* involve snippets of *Code* written in a *Text language* but they could also be used as an approach for assessing students' understanding of *Coding* concepts in *Blocks languages* like *Scratch*.
We have created an example of a [Parsons' Problem created in Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/181770284/){:target="_blank"} to demonstrate how a *Parsons' Problem* could work for a *Blocks language*.
